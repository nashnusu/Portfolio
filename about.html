            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I grew up in the vibrant, chaotic, and endlessly inspiring city of Dhaka, where curiosity was always my north star. Whether it was flipping through books late into the night or getting swept up in ideas bigger than myself, I was always drawn to the why and how behind the world around me.

              One of my most vivid memories from that time is a climb I made to the hilltops of Bandarban and Rangamati — a trip that pushed me physically, mentally, and emotionally. The terrain was wild and unpredictable, but the reward at the top — endless skies and quiet strength — stayed with me. That moment became a metaphor for how I move through life: with heart, grit, and a hunger for perspective.</p> 
      
                          
              <p> In my early twenties, I moved to Stockholm for higher studies and to chase new dreams. The shift from the bustling streets of Dhaka to the calm, minimalistic corners of Sweden changed me — it taught me to embrace contrast, to slow down, and to listen more. Travel became a part of me. So did technology.</p> 
                          
                          
              <p> That’s how I found my way into coding — fascinated by how things are built, connected, and brought to life through code. I’m currently immersed in learning both front-end and back-end development, working with JavaScript, python, Node.js, data analysis technologies and beyond. I love the challenge of building something that’s both beautiful and functional, thoughtful and efficient.</p> 
                          
              <p> Outside of code, I’m drawn to movement, stories, and meaningful moments. I love horse riding, the thrill of adventure sports, long walks through new cities, and books that spark reflection. I thrive around people — their energy, their experiences, and the unexpected things we learn from one another.</p> 
                          
              <p>  Right now, I’m on a journey — not just to become a tech-geek, but to grow into someone who builds things with intention. With every challenge I take on, I carry my roots, my climbs, and my curiosity with me. </p>
