This is a personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, and background as a developer. It’s designed to provide a quick and clear introduction to who I am and what I do. The site is aimed at potential employers, collaborators, and anyone interested in my work — offering a simple, responsive, and accessible way to explore my journey.


### The 5 Planes of UX

#### 1. Strategy

**Purpose**
The portfolio website is designed to present my skills, background, and projects as an aspiring full-stack developer in a clean and engaging way.
**Primary User Needs**
Visitors need to quickly understand who I am, what I do, and how to view or contact me regarding my work.
**Business Goals**
To increase visibility, build credibility as a developer, and encourage collaboration or hiring opportunities.

#### 2. Scope

**[Features](#features)** (see below)
-Responsive navigation bar
-Sectioned content (About, Education, Projects, Contact)
-Project descriptions with GitHub links
-Contact form
**Content Requirements**
-Concise personal introduction
-Project overviews and visuals
-Educational background
-Contact mechanism
-Link to GitHub and live projects

#### 3. Structure

**Information Architecture**
-Navigation Menu: Fixed navbar linking to all major sections
-Hierarchy: Headings and sections organized for scannability
-Accessibility: Clear color contrast and alt text for images
**User Flow**
1.User lands on the home page → sees intro
2.Navigates to About → learns background and story
3.Views Education and Projects → understands qualifications and skills
4.Clicks GitHub links or uses contact form → takes action

#### 4. Skeleton
The site has four main sections: Home, About, Education, and Get in Touch.
Navigation: Links to all sections.
User Flow: Explore Home, About, Education, then contact via Get in Touch.

#### 5. Surface

**Visual Design Elements**
-Colours: Earthy tones like green (#4B5320) and beige (#F5F5DC) create a calm, professional atmosphere.
-Typography: Clean sans-serif fonts like Arial ensure readability and a modern look.
-Visual Balance: Ample whitespace and selective use of icons and images maintain a balanced, visually appealing layout.

### Colour Scheme
The color palette for my portfolio includes:
#4B5320: Earthy green for primary elements like the background and header.
#F5F5DC: Soft beige for text and accents.
#FFFFFF: White for highlights and contrast.
These colors create a calm, professional, and welcoming atmosphere.

### Typography
Fonts: The site uses Arial for body text, with sans-serif as a fallback for readability.
Icons: Native CSS and SVG icons are used, no external icon libraries.

## Wireframes
No wireframes were created for this project. Instead, I focused on building a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Below are screenshots of the actual website displayed on different devices:

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/nashnusu/Portfolio/projects)  was used to organize and track progress using a Kanban board. Tasks were split into user stories and managed through GitHub Issues.

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/nashnusu/Portfolio/issues) All issues raised during development were successfully closed, ensuring a complete and polished final product

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into User Stories for prioritizing and implementing them. Using this approach, I was able to apply "MoSCoW" prioritization and labels to my User Stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: Form needs a success message - required to Pass the project 
- **Should Have**: Website layout not responsive in smaller gadgets
- **Could Have**: Replace float with flex 

## Testing

> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

### GitHub Pages

The site was deployed to GitHub Pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/nashnusu/Portfolio), navigate to the "Settings" tab.
- In Settings, click on the "Pages" link from the menu on the left.
- From the "Build and deployment" section, click the drop-down called "Branch", and select the **master** branch, then click "Save".
- The page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed message display to indicate the successful deployment.
- Allow up to 5 minutes for the site to fully deploy.

The live link can be found on [GitHub Pages](https://nashnusu.github.io/Portfolio).
 
### Local VS Deployment

There are no remaining major differences between the local version when compared to the deployed version online.
